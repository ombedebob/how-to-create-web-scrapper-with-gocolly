# how-to-create-web-scrapper-with-gocolly

gocolly is an important go library and is perfect for
web scraping. I took the challenge and learned how to build
a web scrapper that can source data from a website.
I plan on building my own advance webscrapping application 
and understanding gocolly is the first step

the website scrapped in this project is the standard 
website called scrap me built solely for learning purposes
in the learning processes i implemented the process
on a local ecommerce website it worked perfectly well
